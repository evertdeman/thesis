# Visualization

This directory contains files for the visualization of the classifier results, in addition to some code for other figures in the thesis. 

Files:
- `all_results.ipynb` file where all raw data is wrangled into the tables that are needed for visualization; 
- `chisq.ipynb` calculations of $\chi^2$-tests of independence between confound(s) and label $y$ (not complete); 
- `pbcc_plot.ipynb` plots for the prediction based confound control by Dinga et al.; 
- `thesis_plots_id.ipynb` plots for the identification task in my thesis (main part); 
- `vis-pred.ipynb` plots for the prediction task in my thesis (only one big plot with all results in there); 
- `vis.py` many utilities, functions etc. that are used in all Jupyter Notebooks in this directory.
